# Optimind Docs

Apply Optimind brand styling to Word documents — branded cover page, Poppins typography, semantic colors, header/footer, table and callout variants — without changing any source content.

## What this plugin does

When installed, this plugin gives Claude a new skill: **`/polish-doc`**. You can type the slash command, or just ask Claude in plain English — "polish a Word doc" or "apply Optimind branding to this report" — and it will:

1. Read your `.docx` file.
2. Infer the document title, client, and reporting period and ask you to confirm them.
3. Produce a branded copy of the document — new cover page, consistent typography, styled headings, tables, and callouts — saved to `~/OptimindDocs/output/`.

**Source text is never altered.** The polisher verifies content preservation before saving, and aborts if anything it was about to write would change the underlying text, numbers, or dates.

## Installation

### Where this works

This plugin is a **Claude Code plugin**, so it only loads in surfaces that consume the Claude Code plugin system:

- **Claude Code** (CLI, Desktop, or IDE extension) — ✅ supported
- **Claude Cowork** — ✅ supported
- **Claude.ai web chat** — ❌ not supported (claude.ai doesn't load Claude Code plugins). The skill will not appear there.

### Option A — Install from this GitHub marketplace (recommended)

Run these **two** commands, in order, inside Claude Code / Cowork:

```
/plugin marketplace add lqxdesign/optimind-docs_polisher-agent
/plugin install optimind-docs@optimind
```

| Step | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/plugin marketplace add …` | Registers the catalog (one-time). On its own, this does **not** install anything — it only tells Claude where the plugin lives. |
| `/plugin install optimind-docs@optimind` | Installs the `optimind-docs` plugin from the registered marketplace. |

> Claude Code's plugin system is a two-step flow by design (add marketplace → install plugin). There is no single-command shortcut for third-party marketplaces; the `claude plugin install name@claude-plugins-official` pattern only works for Anthropic's official auto-loaded marketplace.

After install, **restart Claude Code** so the skill is picked up. Confirm it's there by opening `/plugin` → **Installed** tab, or by typing `/` and looking for `polish-doc` in the slash-command picker.

Pull later updates:

```
/plugin marketplace update optimind
```

Restart Claude Code after updating. It will refresh to the latest version on the repo's `main` branch.

### Option B — Install from `.plugin` file (offline / blocked networks)

1. Grab the latest `optimind-docs.plugin` from the repo's [Releases page](../../releases).
2. Claude Desktop → **Settings → Plugins → Install from file** → pick the downloaded file.
3. Restart Claude Code.

Once installed, the `/polish-doc` skill is available.

### Requirements

- **macOS or Windows** (Linux also works).
- **Python 3** on your `PATH`.
  - macOS: usually preinstalled. If not, `brew install python`.
  - Windows: download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and tick **"Add Python to PATH"** during install.

That's it. On first run the plugin:

1. Creates its own isolated Python environment and installs its libraries (`python-docx`, `docxtpl`, `lxml`) — takes ~30 seconds.
2. Installs the **Poppins** font family into your user font folder **only if it's not already on your system** (checked across `~/Library/Fonts`, `/Library/Fonts`, and `/System/Library/Fonts` on macOS; `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Fonts` and `C:\Windows\Fonts` on Windows; `~/.local/share/fonts` and `/usr/share/fonts` on Linux). No admin rights needed.

Every run after that is instant.

## How to use

1. In Claude, say something like:
   - "Polish this Word doc."
   - "Apply Optimind branding to `~/OptimindDocs/input/report.docx`."
   - "Brand the Google Ads report for MDC Group."

2. Claude will ask for the file path (or read it from `~/OptimindDocs/input/` if you've dropped one there) and confirm the cover details with you.

3. The polished file is written to `~/OptimindDocs/output/` with the same filename as the input.

### Folder convention

```
~/OptimindDocs/
  ├── input/    ← drop Word files here
  └── output/   ← polished copies appear here
```

Both folders are created the first time the plugin runs. You can also pass an absolute path to a file anywhere on disk — the input folder is a convenience, not a requirement.

Set the environment variable `OPTIMIND_DOCS_OUTPUT` to override the output location if you want polished files saved elsewhere.

## Table variants

The polisher ships with two table styles from the Optimind design system:

- **Classic** (default) — red header row, alternating zebra rows.
- **Minimal** — rule-based, no fills. Best for dense numeric comparison tables.

Ask Claude to use `--table-style minimal` or `--table-style auto` if you want a different variant. `auto` picks Minimal for mostly-numeric tables and Classic otherwise.

## Design system source of truth

Colors, fonts, and spacing in the output all come from the Optimind Docs Kit Figma file:

- File: [Optimind Docs Kit](https://www.figma.com/design/iYE9CtCoxRESvSGtTrfBhs/Optimind-Docs-Kit)
- Page: `Doc`

If tokens change in Figma, update both `skills/polish-doc/references/ui-kit.md` and the matching `RGBColor` constants at the top of `scripts/polish_doc.py`.

## Troubleshooting

**"Python 3 was not found on this machine."**
The plugin couldn't locate `python3`. Install Python 3 (`brew install python` or download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) and try again.

**"Content-preservation check failed."**
The polisher detected that it was about to write a file whose text differed from the input. This is a safety guard — the script aborted on purpose. Re-ask Claude to run it, and if it keeps failing, open an issue with the input document (content stays local; don't share sensitive files).

**Fonts look wrong in the output (wrong typeface, odd spacing).**
The first run installs Poppins automatically into your user font folder, but Word/Pages sometimes needs to be restarted before it sees newly-installed fonts. Quit and reopen Word (or Pages), then reopen the polished document. Note: Apple Pages substitutes fonts more aggressively than Word — for the cleanest result, open the output in Microsoft Word or Google Docs. If Poppins still isn't picked up, check whether it actually landed:

- macOS: open Font Book and search for "Poppins".
- Windows: open **Settings › Personalization › Fonts** and search for "Poppins".

If it's missing, run the polisher again — the font-install step is idempotent.
